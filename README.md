# 🏥 Hospital Management System (HMS) – MySQL Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a MySQL-based Hospital Management System designed to manage and analyze data for patients, doctors, and nurses. It simulates real-life hospital operations such as billing, salary tracking, room assignments, and workload distribution.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design a relational database for a hospital
- Perform data manipulation using SQL (INSERT, UPDATE, ALTER, etc.)
- Generate reports using JOINs and subqueries
- Analyze key metrics such as payment status, salary trends, and workload distribution
- Identify operational inefficiencies and suggest improvements

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- MySQL
- SQL Queries (JOINs, Subqueries, Aggregates)
- Data Analysis
- GitHub for version control and sharing

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Billing Status:** 40% of patients are fully paid, while 60% are either unpaid or on installment—indicating potential financial bottlenecks.
- **Nurse Salaries:** Inconsistent salary values suggest a lack of centralized payroll, with an average of ₦560,000.
- **Doctor Workload:** All doctors are managing an equal number of patients (2 each), reflecting fair distribution but not case complexity.
- **Nurse Assignments:** Nurses are handling multiple patients across rooms, possibly impacting punctuality and efficiency.

## ✅ Recommendations
- Implement pre-admission payment plans and follow-up billing mechanisms
- Standardize salary structures and improve payroll transparency
- Align nurse shifts based on residential location to reduce fatigue
- Use patient complexity to assign doctor workloads more efficiently

## 📂 Files Included
- `hospital_database.sql` – SQL script to create and populate tables
- `HMS_Insights_Report.pdf` – Summary of findings and recommendations


## 🚀 How to Use
1. Import the SQL file into your MySQL environment
2. Run the queries from `data_analysis_queries.sql`
3. Explore and modify the database for additional insights

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me
I'm a beginner in data analysis and this is my first hands-on SQL project. I'm learning how to use SQL and GitHub to build and share data-driven insights.
